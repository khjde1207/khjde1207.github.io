How to use it (must read): 

This application has a lot of functions, so I recommend you read it one by one. 

1. How to view files:   
Please click Add File in my document to add txt.   
Touch the txt file and press the open button at the bottom to view the file. 


2. How to hide viewer ads / bottom navigation buttons: 
Double tap the center of the screen. 
As you switch to the full screen, the ads and buttons disappear. 


3. To change the button mitt function area:
You can change it under Settings - Touch Area Settings.
You can set a number of functions, including full screen, page movement, brightness adjustment, and volume control.  
Bluetooth remote control is also supported, so you can lie down and watch it comfortably. 


4. To change font or font size:
You can change the font or font size under Settings - Settings - Font Settings. 
You can use the font by pressing the Download button to receive dozens of free fonts. 


5. How to use image text conversion:   
You can extract text from a compressed image. This is called the OCR function. 
My Journal - Click Add File and add a zip file. 
You can convert by selecting the zip file and then selecting the OCR menu. 
The page is consumed during conversion. 
OCR works with AI, so its speed and accuracy are quite good. 


6. epub, pdf conversion method: 
It's the same as the image conversion method. 
There are a few things to be aware of. 
Epub or pdf may be "encrypted". 
It is mainly used to break letters and make them visible only in certain fonts. 
In this case, it comes out like an extraterrestrial character, not Korean, so you can't read it in TTS. 
As a way to solve this problem, the function of extracting images can be used, and then the OCR can be rotated to extract.  


7. How to set up TTS: 
TTS-related settings are concentrated in Settings - TTS Settings, TTS Filter Settings. 
The TTS settings include simple TTS features, such as voice, speed, volume, button transparency, characters ending sentences, and the number of sentences read at a time, as well as devices that complement the TTS features. 
The number of sentences read at a time is a function added to allow multiple lines to be read at once to be heard with minimal delay. 
The TTS filter is one of the most powerful features of this application. 
[TTS Filter Settings] allows you to set a number of special characters, words or sentences that you need to skip. 
If you press the download button, you can download dozens of filters that I produced. 
You can also add it yourself if you need it. 
[Automatic shutdown function] can set the automatic shutdown time by touching the moon-shaped icon on the left side of the stop button when playing TTS. 


8. Description of backup and recovery capabilities: 
Setup - Backup and Recovery is a feature that allows multiple devices to use the application in the same environment. 
You can log in to the drive for backup recovery. 
When viewed from multiple devices, such as PCs, phones, and pads, you can use Location Backup to synchronize your viewing location. 
Select the device you want to autosynchronize and turn on the Autosynchronization feature to automatically move to the last location when you run the application or go home and return.  

9. How to use text batch modification: 
1. [Settings - Settings - Bulk Edit button]
2. [Settings - Edit text collectively]
You can use batch modification in two ways. 
In case of number 1, it is used to listen to TTS and to erase or change the sentence to another character if some sentences or words are annoying. 
In case of number 2, you can extract the text with OCR and select the text file from the document to perform a batch correction. 
You can also use the download button to download and use frequently occurring recognition errors for batch correction of text. 
Bulk Corrections - Downloads will only show the list if the language settings are in Korean. 
This is because developers don't speak other languages. 
If you report using the report function, I will add the language of the country. 

10. If there is a jarring sentence when listening to TTS, work it out: 
If it doesn't matter if the original is modified, please change it to the [Collective Modification] function. 
After the change, the backup file will remain in my library, so if you accidentally modify it, you can recover it again. 
If you want to remove the original only from TTS without touching it, use the TTS filter. 

11. Page related description: 
If you use special functions such as TTS sentence inspection, batch correction, reorganization of lines, and translation, pages will be consumed, but since it is about 10 to 50, you will not feel it consumed. 
Most pages are likely to be used to feel when extracting text from OCR, epub, and pdf. 
When extracting text, we do not only extract single-handedly, but also organize sentences by making dozens of problems that emerge after extraction into patterns. 
It's a part that was really hard to implement, so please try it.


12. Advertising description: 
I'm both a developer and a user. 
We've added advertisements to the extent that they don't interfere with use as much as possible. 
Advertisements include page-secure ads and ad removal ads. 
A page can hold up to 60,000 pages. 
When removing advertisements, you can use the page to remove advertisements for a certain period of time. (Excluding sleep time, it's about a day.)
For those who are pre-stacking pages, you can remove the viewer-side advertisement by consuming 2000 pages. 
When you consume 8000 pages, all ads are disabled except for the 30-second ads for page acquisition and the native ads in the middle of the settings. 
8000 page ads have been added for those who are bothered by short ads that pop up during a large amount of conversion.


13. Feature description for Ear (History Interworking): 
It supports the Ear View function. 
For example, let's say we have a document titled A (1 to 50), and we have a new document called A (1 to 100). 
In this case, it is already necessary to skip the main position. 
When you select a text file in my library, the Ear View menu appears.
If you select this menu and then select A (1 to 50) in History, it will automatically skip the previously viewed position. 
When you have time later, please remove A (1-50) from the history. 
In history, the total number of books read is also counted. 
If the same document remains, inaccurate information may be displayed. 


14. Bookmark/note/starring description: 
The app supports notes and bookmark/starring. 
If you turn on the bookmark function in bookmark settings, you can add it by pressing and holding text. 
The Notes feature allows you to select and enter a file if you have opened it at least once. 
If you open a file at least once, a star appears at the top of the file selection. 
Notes and horoscopes can be used to record evaluations of the file itself. 
Bookmarks can be used to record important content. 



14. TTS Sentence Examiner Description: 
When I looked at a lot of documents, I began to see a pattern of well-written and not-written texts. 
I found a pattern that always comes out in unfortunate texts. 
I organized this pattern and produced it by weighting each pattern. 
We named it [Mine Search] at first.
However, this function was made with too subjective judgment, so I changed it to TTS sentence checker.
This feature supports Korean only. 
I don't know the language of other countries, so I can't organize my patterns whether it's good or bad. 
If there is a pattern like this in other countries, please send it to us by e-mail. 
Once you can support multiple national languages, we will move the function to Settings. 
There is still one spot left in the settings. 


15. Explanation of the function of the dog administration:
This is a method that can be used if the sentence is not finished but the entry is down. 
Usually, this happens a lot to documents that are worked with the ocr conversion. 
This feature is not just a combination of enter. 
It is a function that is implemented by analyzing documents with numerous opening errors and organizing the patterns. 
I tried to introduce AI to organize it, but it wasn't easy. 
There is a lot of research on natural language processing these days, so I will add it if I can process it with AI later. 

16. Translation Function Description: 
Local translation / Web browser translation functionality is supported. 
Local translation is a function that translates into AI developed by Google. Simple words can be translated well, but there seem to be a lot of mistranslations in sentence translation. 
Web browser translation is a function that displays sentences to be translated in a browser. 
If you turn on the translation function in Settings - Translation Settings and press and hold the sentence, the translation function will work. 

17. Other matters: 
When you open a document, the entry that repeats more than three times will be opened by switching to two times. 
Excessive enter is inconvenient to listen to with TTS and uncomfortable to see. 
Some of you might have already noticed from using my app for a long time. "Hmm? Some of you might think, "I've never seen a lot of entertainment." 
We've implemented as much functionality as the text viewer can support. 

I wrote down 17 uses, but I don't think I've used half of them yet. 
Simple functions such as background color, background image, letter color, and page turning method have been omitted. 
I hope this document will help many people. 
If you look at Settings - Information and Help, there is a link to the Telegram group chat, so if you have any questions, you can come in and ask. 
Thank you for reading to the end.
