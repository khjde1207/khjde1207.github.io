How to use (must read):

This app has a lot of features, so I recommend reading through it.

1. How to view files:
Please click Add File in My Library to add txt.
You can view the file by touching the txt file and pressing the open button at the bottom.


2. How to hide viewer advertisements/bottom navigation buttons:
Double-tap the center of the screen.
When it switches to full screen, ads and buttons disappear.


3. How to change the button and function area:
You can change it in [Settings - Touch Area Settings].
You can set various functions such as full screen, page movement, brightness control, and volume control.
A Bluetooth remote control is also supported, so you can place it on a stand and view it comfortably while lying down.


4. How to change font or text size:
You can change the font or font size in [Settings - Settings - Font Settings].
You can use dozens of free fonts by clicking the download button.


5. How to use the image to text conversion function:
You can extract text from compressed images. This is called the OCR function.
My Library - Click Add File and add the zip file.
You can convert by selecting the zip file and then selecting the OCR menu.
Pages are consumed during conversion.
OCR is done with AI, so its speed and accuracy are quite good.


6. How to convert epub to pdf:
It's the same as the image conversion method.
There are a few things to keep in mind.
In the case of epub or pdf, it may be “encrypted”.
The most common method is to make letters garbled and visible only in specific fonts.
In this case, it cannot be read using TTS because it looks like an alien character rather than Korean.
To solve this problem, you can use the image extraction function and then use OCR to extract it.


7. How to set up TTS:
TTS-related settings are concentrated in [Settings - TTS Settings] and [TTS Filter Settings].
TTS settings include not only simple TTS features such as voice, speed, volume, button transparency, sentence ending character, and number of sentences read at once, but also devices that complement the TTS function are added.
The number of sentences read at once is a function added to allow you to read multiple lines at once and listen with minimal delay.
TTS filter is one of the most powerful features of this app.
In [TTS Filter Settings], you can set various special characters, words or sentences that should be skipped.
If you click the download button, you can download dozens of filters I created.
You can also add your own if necessary.
[Automatic shutdown function] allows you to set the automatic shutdown time by touching the moon-shaped icon to the left of the stop button when playing TTS.


8. Backup and recovery function description:
[Settings - Backup and Recovery] is a function created to allow you to use the app in the same environment on multiple devices.
You can log into the drive and restore backups.
When viewing on multiple devices such as PC, phone, or pad, you can synchronize the viewing location using location backup.
If you select a device to automatically synchronize and turn on the [Auto Sync] function, it will automatically move to the last viewed location when you run the app or leave and return to the home page.

9. How to use batch edit text:
1. [Settings - Settings - Show batch edit button]
2. [Settings - Bulk edit text]
Bulk editing can be used in two ways.
In case 1, if some sentences or words are annoying while listening to TTS, it is used to erase the sentences or change them to other characters.
In case 2, you can extract text using OCR and then select text files from My Library to perform batch editing.
You can also use the download button to batch edit text to download frequently occurring recognition errors.
[Batch Edit - Download] will only display the list if the language setting is Korean.
This is because developers do not know how to speak other languages.
If you report it using the report function, we will add the language of your country.

10. Solution if there is a sentence that is annoying when listening to TTS:
If you don't mind the original being modified, please use the [Batch Edit] function to change it.
After changes, a backup file will remain in My Library, so if you make changes by mistake, you can restore them.
If you want to remove only TTS without touching the original, use the TTS filter.

11. Point related explanation:
Points are consumed when using special functions such as TTS sentence checking, batch editing, line arrangement, and translation, but since they are about 10 to 50, you will not feel the consumption.
Most of the points are likely to be used to a degree that can be felt when extracting text from OCR, epub, and pdf.
When extracting text, we do not just extract the text, but also create patterns from dozens of problems that arise after extraction and proceed with sentence organization.
This part was implemented with great difficulty, so please try using it at least once.


12. Advertising related explanation:
I am both a developer and a user.
Advertisements have been added to the extent that they do not interfere with use as much as possible.
There are two types of advertisements: points securing advertisements and advertisement removal advertisements.
You can hold up to 60,000 points.
When removing ads, you can use points to remove ads for a certain period of time. (Excluding sleeping time, it is approximately one day.)
For those who accumulate points in advance, you can remove viewer-side advertisements by consuming 2000 points.
When you consume 8000 points, all advertisements will be disabled except for the 30-second advertisement to secure points and the native advertisement in the middle of the settings.
The 8000 point advertisement was added for those who find it annoying to see short advertisements that pop up when performing large conversion tasks.


13. Description of continuation (history linkage) function:
Supports continuous viewing function.
For example, let's say there is a document titled A(1~50), but you now receive a new document titled A(1~100).
In this case, you already need to skip the main location.
When you select a text file in My Library, the Continue menu appears.
After selecting this menu, if you select A (1~50) in the history, it will automatically skip the previously viewed location.
When you have time later, please remove A (1~50) from the history.
In History, the total number of books read is also counted.
If the same document remains, inaccurate information may be displayed.


14. Bookmark/memo/star rating description:
The app supports memo and bookmark/star rating functions.
If you turn on the bookmark function in the bookmark settings, you can add it by long pressing the text.
The memo function allows you to select and enter a file if you have opened and viewed the file at least once.
If you open a file even once, there is a star at the top when you select the file.
Notes and ratings can be used to record evaluations of the file itself.
Bookmarks can be used to record important information.



14. TTS sentence checker description:
As I looked through numerous documents, I began to see patterns between well-written and not-so-well-written articles.
I discovered a pattern that always appears in disappointing articles.
This is a function that I created by organizing these patterns and giving weight to each pattern.
At first, this function was named [Minesweeper].
However, this function was created based on too subjective judgment, so it was changed to TTS sentence checker.
This feature only supports Korean.
Because I don't know other countries' languages well, I couldn't figure out whether the writing was good or bad.
If there is a pattern like this in other countries, please report it via email.
Once we can support multiple national languages, we will move the feature to Settings.
There is still one space left in the settings.


15. Description of line break function:
Line break theorem is a method that can be used when the sentence is not finished but the enter key is pressed.
This phenomenon usually occurs in documents processed through OCR conversion.
This function doesn't just combine Enter.
This function was implemented by analyzing documents with numerous newline errors and organizing the patterns.
I tried to introduce organizing using AI, but it wasn't easy.
These days, a lot of research is being done on natural language processing, so if we can process it with AI in the future, we will try to add it.

16. Translation function description:
Supports local translation/web browser translation functions.
Local translation is a function that translates using AI developed by Google. Simple words are translated well, but there seem to be quite a few mistranslations in sentence translation.
Web browser translation is a function that displays the sentence to be translated in the browser.
If you turn on the translation function in [Settings - Translation Settings] and press and hold the sentence, the translation function will work.

17. Other matters:
When opening a document, Earapp will automatically change the Enter key repeated three or more times to twice.
Excessive enters are uncomfortable to listen to and view through TTS.
Some of you may have already noticed this while using my app for a long time, and say, “Hmm? Now that I think about it, I’ve never seen you press enter a lot?” Some people may think so.
We have implemented as many features as possible in the text viewer.

I wrote down seventeen ways to use it, but I don't think I've even written half of it yet.
Simple functions such as background color, background image, text color, and point turning method have been omitted.
I hope this article will be helpful to many people.
If you look at [Settings - Information and Help], there is a link to the Telegram group chat room, so if you have any questions, you can come in and ask.
thank you for reading.
